 Rossmann Sales Analysis

This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline for Rossmann retail sales—from raw data cleaning in Python to a fully interactive Power BI dashboard.

 Python Data Cleaning

The raw sales data included missing values, inconsistent date formats, and irrelevant columns. I used Python to:

- Merge multiple datasets from different sources
- Standardize date formats and fix data types
- Remove nulls, duplicates, and unnecessary columns
- Export a clean dataset for dashboarding

- `data/cleaned/rossmann_sales_cleaned.csv`

 📊 Power BI Dashboard

Using the cleaned dataset, I built a Power BI dashboard that visualizes:

- Branch performance and product line sales
- Customer type breakdowns and seasonal trends
- Key metrics like revenue, ratings, and top stores

 Purpose

This project is part of my professional portfolio, showcasing my ability to clean real-world retail data, troubleshoot inconsistencies, and deliver actionable insights through visual storytelling.
